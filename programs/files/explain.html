The insinuation is to use your disc drive as a cupholder. Pretty hilarious when you just see it in the wild and run it out of curiosity. Sadly the joke doesn't work very well these days as dvr drives are disappearing from computers as more and more content is stored in the cloud or on thumb drives.</span></h4>
