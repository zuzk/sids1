There weren't any drivers available but the baseline ones and those require a semi-complicated installation. I used the stick a lot on pcs and still do sometimes when I need wifi on a device without a wireless card so having a quick and easy way to install the drivers was something I really wanted to have. Won't be useful to you but here are the links anyways if you want to look at the code or something idk</p>
